# 🏛️ IPS :: STRATIGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL TERMINAL [NODE-14847]
## Institutional Operational Overview :: Secure Access Mode

**CLASSIFICATION:** PUBLIC ACCESS (RESTRICTED TO READ-ONLY)  
**AUTHORITY:** INSTITUTE FOR PRECEDENT STUDIES  
**EPOCH:** 14,847 POST-INSTITUTIONAL (PI)  

---

## 1. SYSTEM DESIGNATION

This terminal serves as the primary interface for the retrieval and visualization of deep-time data fragments. It is not a repository of truth, but a **stratigraphic window** into the civilizational ruins of the Post-Institutional (PI) and Ante-Institutional (AI) epochs.

The system is designed to facilitate **Mosaic Comprehension**—allowing observers to reconstruct high-resolution understandings of the past through contradictory testimonies, scholarly analysis, and verbatim artifactual data.

## 2. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE :: THE IN-MEMORY SYNTHESIS

Unlike legacy archival systems, Node-14847 utilizes a **Volatile Stratigraphic Engine** (SQLite Wasm). The archive does not persist in a static state; rather, it is synthesized in-memory upon every boot sequence.

### A. The SQL Ruins
The system initializes by ingesting "SQL Ruins" (`/assets/database/schema.sql` and `seed.sql`). These files represent the raw, encoded strata of historical jurisprudence.

### B. Memory Allocation
Upon boot, the engine allocates an isolated memory sector to house the stratigraphic database. This session is **ephemeral**. When the observer terminates the link, the memory is purged, ensuring the "Archive" remains a dynamic, active process rather than a stagnant relic.

### C. Stratigraphic Retrieval (Querying)
Observers interact with the strata through specific retrieval web-components (`tg-box`, `tg-case-list`, etc.). These components act as physical excavation tools, querying the in-memory database to surface fragments based on:
- **Strata Depth (m):** Literal physical depth of the artifact at the time of recovery.
- **Isotope Variance:** A metric of temporal drift and semantic corruption.
- **Phenomenological Marker:** Recognition of patterns Alpha (Stillness), Beta (Fracture), and Gamma (Invalidation).

## 3. OPERATIONAL BOOT SEQUENCE

To initiate stratigraphic retrieval via this node:

1.  **Environment Initialization:** Load the `sql-wasm.js` substrate.
2.  **Stratigraphic Injection:** Execute schema and seed sequences to populate the in-memory database.
3.  **Component Hydration:** Wait for the `IPS_DB` singleton to stabilize before rendering data frames.
4.  **CRT Calibration:** Apply scanline overlays and flicker animations to anchor the physical metaphor of the interface.

## 4. DATA INTEGRITY & THE EPISTEMIC AXIS

Observers must be advised that **Record Authenticity** is not guaranteed. The Institute prioritizes the integrity of the **Fragment** over the comfort of the reader.

- **Contradictions:** Discrepancies between Case Analysis and Fragment Testimony are intentional and represent the stratigraphic "rubble" of history.
- **Corruption Utilities:** Character and sector loss (`██████`) are verbatim representations of artifactual damage.
- **Faux-Precision:** The decimal values assigned to depth and confidence are bureaucratic artifacts of the Institute's clinical categorization method.

## 5. ARCHIVE MANDATES

- **MANDATE 0.1:** The record is not the event; it is the scar the event left on the strata.
- **MANDATE 0.2:** Observation is an act of violence against uncertainty.
- **MANDATE 0.3:** Minimal intervention. Let the ruins speak.
